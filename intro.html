As we reach the 21st century, 
the influx of new technology has reached its peak,
and many of them are being implemented in diverse fields 
of our modern society.
Considering market operability, most of the technologies or 
trends lie in I.T. or computing tech. The rise of the NFT is not an exception.

    <b>Then what is NFT?</b> NFT, which stands for Non-Fungible Token, 
    is a unique identifier that may act as digital encrypted product copyright (Denicola, 2022). 
    Some may believe that the only function of these tokens is copyrighted, but the complexity of such technology lies far beyond it. 
    The explanation of the NFT may be represented from the word itself, ‘Non-fungible’ items aren’t interchangeable. Each token has unique properties, 
    and the worth of the product isn’t worth the same as other similar tokens. Then how does the system work? The majority of the NFTs are created and stored on the Ethereum network (2022). Other blockchains also support the system. Hence, since its digitally recorded, the ownership of the tokens can be verified and traced without hardship. Different types of goods can be tokenized, artwork items in-game, stills of the video, 
    and even the highlight moments captured by the media.
